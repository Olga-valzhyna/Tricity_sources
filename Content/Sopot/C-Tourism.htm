        <h1>Tourism</h1>
        <p>Wide sandy beaches spreading for as long as 4,5 kilometres, the status of a health spa and the longest pier in Europe are a magnet powerful enough to attract tourists here. In spite of being the smallest urban administrative unit in terms of population in the whole country, in the summer it is one of the most crowded and lively places in Poland. Beautifully situated seaside resort is well-known also thanks to the legendary music festival held in Forest Opera (Opera Leśna). The city has a distinctive location: surrounded by the moraine hills and forests from the south and by the Gdańsk Bay and Hel Peninsula from the north. As much as 60% of the city's area is occupied by vegetation. Sopot owes its unique atmosphere to the art nouveau tenement houses, villas surrounded by trees and one of the longest promenades in Poland, commonly known as 'Monciak'. Its favourable geographical location is reflected in the real estate prices - the highest in Poland. The city has a great location - lying between the beautiful woods of the Tricity Landscape Park on one side, and the numerous sandy beaches of the Bay of Gdańsk on the other.
