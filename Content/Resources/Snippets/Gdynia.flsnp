                <p>Gdynia is a distinctive, special place. Constructed in the 1920s, it was the background of a freshly built modern harbor. To this day, the harbor area with its long promenade is the most characteristic part of the city. It is here that the historical ships are docked: the ORP Błyskawica, a 1930s destroyer, which is the oldest preserved ship of this class in the world, and the famous sailing frigate Dar Pomorza. The Naval Museum proudly shows the history of the Polish navy, while the Gdynia Aquarium allows you to discover fascinating secrets of underwater life.</p>
