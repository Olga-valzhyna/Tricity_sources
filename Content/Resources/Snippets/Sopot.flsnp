                <p>Sopot is a luxury seaside resort town, a venue for mass events and a trendy shopping area. Its most recognizable symbol is its pier. Jutting out 560 yards into the sea, it is the longest wooden pier in Europe. At its end, the concentration of iodine is twice the amount recorded on the shoreline, which means that walks along the pier are good for your health. More than a hundred vessels can be moored along the pier at any given time. Plac Zdrojowy, the town’s central square, is the extension of the pier on land. The light-house towering over the square offers a panoramic view of the area, while the nearby outdoor concert hall is alive with music all summer. In winter, the square becomes an ice-skating rink.</p>
